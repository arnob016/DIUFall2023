**Software Engineering**
The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software that is the application of engineering to software.



**Hooker's general Principle of Software Engineering**
1. The reason it all exists.
2. Keep it simple, stupid (KISS).
3. Maintain the vision.
4. What you produce, Others will consume.
5. Be open to the future.
6. Plan ahead for reuse. 
7. Think!


**What is a software?**

A software is an instruction to a computer to perform a task, or a data structure that enable a program to manipulate information, or it can be a document that describing another program.

* Software is not manufactured.
    * Software is developed or engineered.
* Software is intangible that cannot be touched.
* Software does not wear out.
* Software is labour intensive.
* Software is easy to reproduce.
* Software is easy to modify.
* Software needs to be learnt to be engineeered.

Types of Software:

* System Software:
    * OS (windows, linux, mac), Drivers (audio, video, printer), netwroking software(TPC/IP)
    * Telecommunication software(routers, switches, modems)
    * Compilers (VSC, PyCharms, Eclipse)

* Application Software:
    * Word processors, spreadsheets, database systems, web browsers, games, etc.

* Embedded Software:
    * Monitoring system and softwares (aircraft, automobiles, medical devices, etc.)
    * Control systems (robots, traffic lights, etc.)

* Engineering / Scientific Software:
    * Computer aided design (CAD), Electrical Engineering software, Simulation software, etc.

* AI Software:
    * Machine learning, Natural language processing, etc.

* Web Applications:
    * Chrome, Whatsapp, Telegram, Youtube etc.


* Types of Computing:
    * Open World Computing : Distributed computing, Pervasive computing, Cloud computing, etc.
    * Ubiquituos Computing : Wireless and possibly mini sized.
    * Net sourcing : Using Web as computing engine.
    * Open source : Source code that is available publicly free.


**Legacy Software**
Out of date software that needs or has a new replacement or version, but is still in use or has a good working order.
* Needs of replacement:
    * Must be updated/replaced to meet new computing environment or technology.
    * Must be updated/replaced to meet new user requirements.
    * Must be updated/replaced to meet new business requirements.
    * Must be updated/replaced to work in updated network requirements.

**Characteristics of Web Applications**
* Network intensive
* Concurrent users ( Many user accessing at once )
* Evalutions
* Performance
* Security
* Content sensitiveness
* Security
* User Interface/ Aesthetics

**Software Quality**
* Usability
* Efficiency
* Reliability
* Reusability
* Maintainability

**Software Stakeholders**
* Users
* Customers
* Developer
* Development Manager
